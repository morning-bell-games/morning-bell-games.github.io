        <p>Founded in 2024 by Emily Wall, Morning Bell Games operates as a sole-developer game design studio.</p>
        <p>MBG is a passion project born from the founder’s love of video games and making money people happy. Whilst still in it’s infancy, MBG is well on track to grow into a beautiful baby boy in the near future.</p>
        <p>Emily’s pre-gamedev background is in photo/video production (including cinematography, directing, and multimedia art). Benefiting from this experience, MBG’s design philosophy is built on a strong foundation of storytelling, presentation, and vibes.</p>
